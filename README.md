# Simple ToDo

# Brief Overview 
Simeple ToDo is as its name implies. It's not meant to be anything special, Simple ToDo grimly does it's work and then it sits motionless. We can all take a from it's book. Humor aside, this app was created for me to understand the basics of React Hooks. There were points in the project where I thought I may just got back to Component Classes, however I'm glad I did not. This was a fun project to work on with a simple idea that helped me accomplish a goal I set for myself.
